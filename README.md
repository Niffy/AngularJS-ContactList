Contact list task
=

I modified the contact.json so I could read it in as a file on the web server. I also added a new field called ID, this was so it was easier to manipulate a contact based on this when changing views.

I loosely followed the AngularJS basics section and the tutorial pages (predominately step 7), so this is where I started from really, that why you'll see it looks familiar.
